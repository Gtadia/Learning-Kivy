# 1
# We can create a custom widget inside of the .kv file/we don't need to create a class for a custom widget inside of the python
# file. However, if you're going to add anything other than "pass" or certain attributes that are inn the kivy library, then
# we're going to need the python class.

# 2
# When we use GridLayout, we have to define at least one of the two following values
# rows or cols

# 3 
# You can see that size_hint didn't change the size of the button because the buttons in that same column/row didn't change 
# as well so it didn't change anything.

# 4
# This "D" button is in the same column as the "A" button. So if we change the size_hint by the same amount, both the 
# "A" button and the "D" button's width will decrease by 50% (but the height won't change by 10%)
# 
# WE COULD ALSO GIVE IT A "size"/"width" as long as we make the x-axis on size_hint equal to "None" (size will only change 
# the width because we're chanigng the size of every button/element in the same column)

# 5
# You can incorporate custom widgets that you've created inside of other widgets
# (It doesn't have to be widgets that are built into the kivy library)
