# 1 
# It's possible to define and initialize variables within the .kv file, as such.

# 2
# It is possible to add "canvas" to any widget ro layout (because CanvasExample1 is inheriting from
# Widget and all the other layouts are children of the widget class)

# 3
# "Rectangle creates a rectangle on the canvas
# The default values for rectangle are:
#       pos: 0, 0
#       color: white
#       size: 100, 100

# 4
# This is another way of relaying size/position data in dp

# 5
# This centers the bottom left corner of the rectangle in the center, not the center of the rectangle 
# in the center.

# 6
# NOTE: self.center_x and self.center_y just splits self.center into its x and y variables
# We are subtracting by half the width and the height of the rectangle so that we actually center
# it.

# 7 
# This is how you create an ellipse in the .kv file
