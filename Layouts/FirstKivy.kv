# 1
# You can define the layout inside of the .kv file

# 2
# The default orientation is staking the elements "horizontally"

# 3
# Within a widget, you can resize and set the position of the elements such as widgets. This is because widgets do not handle
# the position of the size of the elements. However, layouts set the position to origin of their repsective "block" and set 
# the size_hint to (1, 1)   

# 4
# BoxLayout accepts any type of element/widget (it doesn't all have to be the same type)
