ScrollViewExample:

<ScrollViewExample@ScrollView>: 
    # 1
    StackLayoutExample: 
        size_hint: 1, None  # 2
        # height: 4000 # 3
        height: self.minimum_height # 4


<StackLayoutExample>:


# 1
# The scrollview can only take in one child

# 2
# The size_hint of (1, None) will result in a the stack layout taking up 100% of the ScrollViewExample's size but not bound
# the height to the ScrollViewExample. However, instead we are specifying the height ourselves. If the height of 
# StackLayhoutExample is greater than the total height of the parent (ScrollViewExample), then ScrollView will create a 
# scroll bar for however tall the element is. 
# 
# You can do the same with horizontal scrolling (size_hint: None, 1)

# 3 
# We can manually set the height of the scroll element but that's not a very effective way of creating a scrolling animation.
# This is because the height can either be too much or too little

# 4 
# Within StackLayout, it computes and saves the height that all of its elements takes up as "mimimum_height"
