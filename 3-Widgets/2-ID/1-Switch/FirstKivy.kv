    ToggleButton: 
    # 1
        text: "Toggle Button"
        on_state: root.on_toggle_button_state(self)

    Button:

        disabled: not root.count_enabled 
    Label: 
        text: root.my_text 
    
    Switch:
        size_hint: None, 1

        on_active: root.on_switch_active(self) # 3 
        active: True # 4



# 1 
# The mostly works like the ToggleButton
    # It switches between the on and off state
# However, it will have a different display/look to it
# AND it will have different properties 


# 2
# You can adjust the size of the switch like any other element

# 3 
# on_active returns the state of the switch
# In other words, it's the "on_state" attribute of switches

# 4 
# You can change the default switch position from "False" to "True"
