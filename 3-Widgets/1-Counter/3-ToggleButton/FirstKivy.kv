# 1
# The "Toggle Button" is like a button but it has an on/off state, such like a switch. 
# When you create a toggle button, it looks physically the same as a regular button, except
# for the fact that it stays clicked when you click it. 

# 2
# Instead of "on_press" like the regular button, the "on_state" attribute will execute a function
# when it is "on"/is clicked and it stays highlighted
# 
# If we pass in "self", it will turn in the "ToggleButton" 
# Using this, we can go to the Python file and run <parameter name>.state to get the state of the
# toggle function.
# 
# down      = activated     = on
# normal    = deactivated   = off

# 3
# You can resize the ToggleButton like any other button
