# 1
# "disbaled" is an attribute that specifies whether or not the button is avaliable to be clicked.
# The default value is "False"
# When "True", the button will be grayed out and you won't be able to click it anymore.
# 
# Also, we can use the keyword "not" in order to switch boolean values inside of the .kv file

# REMEMBER:
# You can use the "disabled" attribute/property on any other elements that have user interactions.
