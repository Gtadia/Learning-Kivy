WidgetsExample:

<WidgetsExample>:
    cols: 3
    Button: 
        text: "Click here"
        on_press: root.on_button_click()# 1
    Label: 
        text: root.my_text # 2


# 1 
# The button has a property called "on_press" where you pass in a Python function as its property 
# characteristic/value so that it can do whatever you want it to do using Python (you have to do this
# through the "WidgetsExample" function in the main Python file).

# 2
# "text" is binding, meaning that the text for the label always going to be whatever it's set to,
# which in this case is "root.my_text". The text will adaquately change if, for example, root.my_text 
# changes.
