# 1 
# This is the image widget

# 2
# "source" allows you to type in the directory or the URL of the image that you want to display

# 3
# When you resize the window, the image gets resized accordingly so the entire image is show 
# within the size of the parent. However, when you expand the iamge, the image doesn't get 
# bigger than its original resolution/original size.
#
# This is what "allow_stretch" hopes to resolve. 
# allow_stretch allows the iamge to stretch beyond it's original size.
# (It will continue stretching until it reaches the layout borders)

# 4
# "keep_ratio" allows the image to have the same ratio even when the size of the widgets changes.
# However, in order to use this property, we need to enable "allow_stretch" as well. 
#
# Therefore, the default behavior will try to fill the entire widget size.
