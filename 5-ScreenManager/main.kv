# 1
# We are going to use the WindowManager as the main window and its purpose is to just display the 
# other windows
# 
# That's why we have the other two windows/classes inside of the WindowManger window/class

# 2
# We're able to take the first and second thing

# 3
# "app" is the "App" package that was inherited by the class that builds the app 
# "root" is the "WindowManager" 
# "current" is the current screen that it is on
